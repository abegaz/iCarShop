Start here, follow documentation located here:

Default options should work fine in most areas in the command line with the exception of rewriting the URL for a single page app (select no)


IMPORTANT: once you reach step 5 (deployment) it will almost certainly error and fail. thats because there is a typo in the original code pushed by google

replace the predeploy section in 'firebase.json' with:

"predeploy": [
  "npm --prefix \"%RESOURCE_DIR%\" run lint"
]


then re-run the deployment command

after completion there should be a directory 'public' , put all files here
delete the old index.html and rename the heropage to index.html, this should force the site to display that page when navigating to the default URL

also to note, everytime you deploy the site you are updating the security rules for BOTH the database and storage, which if you do not
 replace the default rules (the ones emplaced in the directory after startup) it will effectively lock out users from reading or writing
