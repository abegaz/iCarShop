The clean version is a 'learner' tutorial for the basics of firebase.
current capabilities: read, write, delete.
I will update with more over the next couple days with a realtime update , and some rudimentary search and sort
*updated as of 10/30/18


The 'modified' version is one expanded and adapted for the vehicle database
currently only has vehicle table but should be easy to add others

Prereqs:
appropriately setup firebase console
hosted in XAMPP just like prior iteration

tip: if the page is not loading changes properly its almost certainly your browser cache catching it (this should probably be forced off in the future)
reload the cache by SHIFT + F5 , or SHIFT + REFRESH
